        "Finding the best routes for a fleet of vehicles to travel in order to serve a group of clients is the goal of the well-known combinatorial optimization problem known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). While meeting certain requirements, such as vehicle capacity and time windows, the goal is to minimize the overall distance traveled or the overall expense incurred. #\n",

        "# My Approach:-\n",

        "By utilizing the strength of quantum algorithms, quantum computing has the potential to transform optimization issues. The goal of my hackathon project is to use the quantum simulator QSim to create a quantum optimization algorithm that will solve the Vehicle Routing Problem.\n",
        "My goal is to create and put into use a quantum algorithm that can quickly determine the best routes for a certain group of clients and vehicles. The algorithm should take into account a variety of restrictions, including restrictions on vehicle capacity, time periods for customer visits, and any other pertinent restrictions particular to the problem instance. #\n",
